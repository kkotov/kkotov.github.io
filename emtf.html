The EMTF [<a href="http://www.slideserve.com/pepin/mtf7-hardware-status/">1</a>,
<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-0221/8/12/C12034">2</a>] is one of the custom-built
electronic systems of the CMS Level-1 Trigger (L1T). By means of pattern recognition EMTF
combines multiple track's segments produced by a particle in sensitive regions of the
detector and evaluates track's properties. The most important property, the particle's
momentum (or transverse momentum), is evaluated from track's bending in the inhomogeneous
magnetic field.
<br><br>
The EMTF system is controlled and monitored via PCI express (PCIe) connection to a regular
PC running the <a href="https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/browser/trunk/cactuscore">SWATCH</a>
cell instance (my pool requests to the cell software:
<a href="https://github.com/batinkov/emtf_cell/pull/1">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/batinkov/emtf_cell/pull/2">2</a>). A low-level management
such as power-on/off sequences, monitoring of electronic components' temperatures, etc. is
performed by the on-board microcontroller now running a
<a href="https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/browser/branches/madorsky_emtf/emtf_1704/mmc/">customized version</a> of
<a href="https://espace.cern.ch/ph-dep-ESE-BE-uTCAEvaluationProject/MMC_project/default.aspx">CERN's MMC library</a>.
<br><br>
The track pT assignment is done with the precomputed values stored in a fast look-up
table (LUT) memory. Thirty bits available for the pT LUT address can encode track's
deflection angles given by relative positions of track segments, bend patters of
individual track segments, and several other potentially useful track's parameters.
The best address composition is a subject of an
<a href="https://github.com/kkotov/emtfPtRegression">ongoing study</a>.
Eighteen bits of pT data encode pT value, track's quality, reconstructed charge.
